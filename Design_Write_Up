Our database follows the following schema:

	UserData: userId, userName
	UserProfile: userId, userName, highestScore, highestRank, totalCatCoins
	HighScores: userId, userName, rank, score
	Shop: itemId, decorationName, price, category
	Cats: userId, userName, catName
	Inventory: userId, userName, itemId,  inUse

We utilize the database to create new users if necessary and to store information regarding the user.  We store information on their highest score, highest rank, total number of coins, their cats, and their inventory items.  We also have the shop storing the possible items that can be purchased. 

We query information regarding the user and also add in rows when necessary (for a new cat).
